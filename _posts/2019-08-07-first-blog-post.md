# My First Blog Post! #

Welcome! This is my first blog post on my personal website. I intend to use this website primarily to highlight what I've done in the past and what I am doing currently. I hope to publish both updates about my education and professional life, as well as this to be an outlet for me to post programming-related musings or psuedo-tutorials on whatever topics interest me at the time.

This site was made using Jekyll and [Jalpc](https://github.com/jarrekk/Jalpc). This was my first substantial foray into front end design, and I have learned a lot. I modified various parts of the Jalpc code to more suite my needs and tastes. I hope to pursue web development more in the future as it is such a useful skill. I tend to work in languages and technologies that aren't too web-based, and I hope to change this.

I am writing some of these posts in retrospect, but I hope that future events will be documented relatively quickly.
