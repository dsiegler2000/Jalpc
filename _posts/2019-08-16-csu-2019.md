This past summer I returned to CSU, again working under Dr. Wenbing Zhao. This summer, I took on a completely different task. The overarching goal of the summer was to create a program that could classify a pitch given a video of the pitch (i.e. is it a fastball, curveball, etc). This is meant as a starting point for various other analysis tools for baseball.

Our findings are being presented this December at the CyberLife conference in Beijing. Thus, I have withheld some of the technical details. Please contact me directly for more information regarding our work or the presentations.

Our work consisted of two main parts. First, we had to get a dataset. A dataset for baseball pitch classification already exists, but for a number of reasons (primarily that the existing dataset was small), we decided to create a new one. We created an extensive pipeline to automate the data collection process. Once we had this automated script, we simply let it run and collected a much larger dataset than previously available.

Second, we had to actually do the classification. We started by researching the area and reading papers; only one paper on baseball pitch classification had been published. A number of papers had been published on the broader topic of video activity recognition, however, compared to other areas of machine learning it is still relatively unexplored. We settled on adapting an already proven model for our task. We then programmed everything to perform transfer learning and load in our custom dataset, as well as fix a lot of bugs and add a lot of logging information. We programmed everything in Python using Tensorflow and Keras. We then trained the model, analyzed what worked and what didn't and then tried to improve. We did this many times. We improved on the previous best results, and this only further motivated us to see how much more we could improve our algorithm on this task. Finally, we analyzed our results for the upcoming publication.

I learned so much from this experience. Going in, I had been interested in machine learning and had done some small projects with it, but this internship forced me to quickly get a good theoretical and practical grounding in a wide variety of topics within machine learning. Beyond the technical knowledge, I further improved my teamwork skills. I was working with one other person to make this project and I was working in a lab with others who were working on other machine learning projects.
