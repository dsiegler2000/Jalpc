I have now been at Georgia Tech for a month, and it has been great so far! I am currently taking:
- PSYC 1101, introductory psychology
- CS 1331, programming in Java
- CS 1100, a freshman seminar course for computer science majors
- MATH 1554, linear algebra
- ENGL 1102, an English class that focuses on women and early film adaptations

Also during these first few weeks I have joined two clubs. First, I joined [The Agency](https://gtagency.github.io/). The Agency is a club that focuses on learning about and doing projects with AI and machine learning. I have just started a project with a group that aims to make an agent do certain tasks in the popular game Minecraft.

I have also join [RoboJackets](https://robojackets.org/), the competative robotics club at Georgia Tech. The club is made up of 5 teams, and I have decided to join the [RoboRacing](https://robojackets.org/teams/roboracing/) team. We compete in the IARRC challenge, which is an RC scale challenge that has drag race, circuit race, and urban navigation challenges. We also for the first year are competing in the EV Grand Prix Autonomous Division, which is a go kart-scaled fully autonomous race.
