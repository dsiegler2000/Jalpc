The summer after my freshman year of high school, the summer of 2016, I worked in a the lab of Dr. Scott Welford. This is a radiation oncology lab at Case Western Reserve University. I got this opportunity by applying through my school. I worked at the lab full time for eight weeks. I worked on exchanging plasmid markers through DNA cloning. At the end of my time there, I prepared and presented a poster on my work, which can be found [here](/static/files/cwru_poster.pdf). At the time I had only taken introductory biology, so this was a deep dive on the cell production and DNA replication processes, along with how plasmid markers can help to create a wide range of drugs especially for treating cancer.

**_This is the poster I made and presented. It is the culmination of my eight weeks of work and learning. I have since improved much further on my writing and poster making skills._**

This was also my first exposure to any real research, and this was probably the most impactful part of my time at CWRU. In retrospective, I learned both research methods and got a small taste of what it would be like to be in research.

I learned many valuable skills in research. I learned about communication. Every week we would have a lab meeting to discuss what everyone is doing. Oftentimes most peoples' work would be largely separate, except for a few small but critical things that would link people together. We always had to understand what we needed to do for each other. We also took this time to review others' presentation and explanation of their material. When I participated in this review process, I saw how it improved my presentation so quickly. I also learned that communicating effectively is critically important, especially in such esoteric areas. Group reviews helped me improve my presentation to the outside world, but even when speaking I had to make sure to be accurate and precise in my words, while at the same time being clear. This skill became especially important as I went into an even more detail-oriented field.

The other major and long-lasting thing I took away from this experience was what it is like to be a researcher. Of course, I only got a small taste of what it was really like to be a researcher. Furthermore, right after this experience I was pretty firmly decided; I didn't want to do institutional research as a career, and if possible, I didn't want to do it ever again. However, upon reflection I realized that research actually very much aligns with my learning style. I am an exploratory learner, and I am interesting in both a breadth and depth of topics. Research can provide both of those things. What I have come to realize is my favorite part of research is that it is basically impossible to fail, because, in the most literal sense, failures are valuable and you can just try again. This requires persistence, but it also means that I get to try new approaches and learn about different things. As I did research more independently, I came to greatly appreciate this aspect of research.

Overall, my summer at Case helped to shape my views on research as well as my own learning style, all while providing a foundation for many valuable skills like effective communication and teamwork.
