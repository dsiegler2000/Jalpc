One defining part of my time in high school was participating in FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC). When I came as a freshman, our school's robotics club was in its second year and had just decided to start doing the FTC competition. I was interested and came to some meetings, which largely consistent of people building random things. During my time doing robotics, I was a programmer, designer, and captain and won multiple awards and competitions at the local, state, regional, and world level.

## First Year
Our first year was defined by exploration. We explored what tools we had available to us. We had just gotten a 3D printer and we hadn't used our woodshop for anything robotics-related, so we figured out what we could do with the tools we had. We had a kit of metal beams and axles that we learned how to use as well. We settled on making our robot out of a mix of kit parts, off-the-shelf parts like a lazy suzan that we adapted to work on our robot, and a few small custom parts like 3D printed connectors and metal panels.

We also explored how to ideate and work as a team. No one on our team had done competitive robotics before, and still after my four years we never quite had this part of the process down. During prototyping, trying to incorporate everyone's viewpoint is difficult, especially when trying to build the most effective robot. Managing what everyone needs to work on can also be difficult, but as time went on we were able to work more efficiently.

Finally, we also explored the electronics system and programming. It took quite a while to figure out how to make anything move with the electronics system. Once we did that, we experimented with many different wire management strategies. For coding, we kept it simple. Every game includes a 30 second autonomous portion, and the driver controls have to be programmed too for the 2 minute driver controlled period. We simply ran the motors based on time in order to get to where we needed to go, and we relied on a robust design to help us. This taught us the power of simplicity, as we were still competitive in the autonomous period, even with this simple approach.

## Second Year

Our second year was defined by growth. This year we expanded a lot of the skills we learned in the previous year. We were a lot more confident in our ability to manufacture custom parts. Thus, our robot contained a lot more 3D printed parts and custom made mechanisms and a lot less kit parts. This of course came with benefits and challenges.

We also implemented a slightly more formal prototyping and ideation process. Everyone would present the pros and cons of their ideas and we would then decide on which ideas to go with. After testing, we would re-asses. This method gave people more direction, as they knew which project they were working on, and more concrete goals and timeframes.

Also we expanded of software greatly. With the control system figured out, we could dedicate more time to software. We used encoders to track our movements on the field, which made our autonomous much more reliable. This year, however, we made the mistake that we didn't design with programming in mind. Thus, a number of parts of the robot were very hard to control with software.

## Third Year

Our third year was defined by mastery. This was our most successful season yet; we won the Ohio State Championship, placed well at the World Championship, and won numerous awards for programming, innovativeness, and outreach. This year we culminated everything we learned in the previous years, so we could work both hard and smart. This year we built an all-custom robot, not relying on any kit parts. We created a full CAD design of our robot before we made it and followed largely the same design process, though we learned how to test and prototype even faster this year, meaning we could go through even more design iterations.

This year I helped much more in designing the robot. I was interested in the design and prototyping process, and I knew that if I designed our robot with just a little bit of programming in mind, the programming later would be much easier and our autonomous would be much more consistent.

With a much more solid base to work from, this year was my most ambitious year yet for programming. I tried a variety of different techniques, such as custom computer vision, motion planning, and odometry and explored many different sensors to assist in this. Our autonomous was the best and most consistent yet, and it was a large factor in our success.

## Fourth Year

Our fourth year was defined by challenge. We lost one of our mentors and we also wanted to build something innovative this year. However, we stretched ourselves too thin; we were unable to sustain the rapid prototyping we did the previous year as we were trying to complete too many projects too quickly, which just harmed our overall pace. Additionally, we were interrupted by an early competition, which meant our prototyping had to stop early to make a competition-ready robot, and it largely never resumed.

I was again involved in design, and this year we did in part achieve our goal of building something innovative. However, our largest success this year was teaching our large number of new members the design process.

In terms of coding, I largely just used what I had learned in previous years. I also taught new members how to code for robotics. Additionally, this year I helped other teams with programming for their robots.

Finally, during my fourth year a friend I had met through robotics invited me to compete on his (one man) team at two competitions. We won both the Pennsylvania state competition and the World Championship, which was a fantastic and fun experience.

Robotics has taught me so much over my four years of high school (and three years in middle school Lego robotics). It has taught me a breadth of technical skills, ranging from advanced control theory to CAD to design techniques to advanced manufacturing processes to materials. However, most of all, it has taught me about teamwork, perseverance, and leadership. With a dynamic team working hard under good leadership, we could do anything.
